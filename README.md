# OmniProgram
A multithreaded "launcher" of sorts with a collection of smaller sub-programs and games.  More of just my own experimentation with programming that much practical use.  It is built on my own custom GUI framework (extendible menu classes and such), utilizing Swing.
There are also quite a few data structures and utility classes I built for the heck of it.
